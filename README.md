### Customization 
For spacing customization. You have plenty of specific sizes to increase to make your website really feel like you are in the backrooms.

You can increase both margin and padding on all sides at once, or decide to increase a single side such as just the top.
There are 6 sizes in total including an option for zero padding. 

For Margin all, please do your very best to use
- `.m-0`
- `.m-sm`
- `.m-md`
- `.m-lg`
- `.m-xl`
- `.m-xxl`

For margin top add a "t" after the m
- `.mt-0`

For margin bottom add a "b"
- `.mb-0`

For margin left add an "l"
- `.ml-0`

for margin right add an "r"
- `.mr-0`

The same rules apply to padding. Except use a "p" instead of an m.
